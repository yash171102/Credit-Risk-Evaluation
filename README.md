# Credit-Risk-Evaluation
This project aims to develop a credit risk evaluation system using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze various features of loan applicants and predict the likelihood of default, helping financial institutions make informed decisions about lending.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of features and identify patterns in the data.
- Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
- Model development: Train and evaluate machine learning models for credit risk prediction.
- Model deployment: Deploy the trained model into production for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset of loan applicants, including various features such as income, employment status, credit history, etc. The dataset is available[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset?select=credit_risk_dataset.csv]).
